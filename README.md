# 6 Companies 30 Days Challenge
A challenge to solve 90 questions asked by 6 famous companies in interview, within 30 days, initiated by <a href = "https://www.youtube.com/@ArshGoyal">Youtuber, Arsh Goyal</a>. This year again, in the challenge, participants would get questions regularly, which have been previously asked in interviews of other companies such as Microsoft, Goldman Sachs, etc. and the participants have to solve them consistently and upload the solutions to their respective Github Repositories. This would for sure boost the participant's confidence appearing for any interview in the future, there are some goodies as well!
